A collection of personal tweaks for WordPress.

== Description ==

This is a simple collection of tweaks for WordPress that I use on my own sites.
I've decided to package them up and share them with the world. I hope you find them useful.

== Installation ==

1. Download the [latest version](https://github.com/ppfeufer/pp-wordpress-tweaks/releases/latest/download/pp-wordpress-tweaks.zip).
2. Go to your WordPress admin area and navigate to `Plugins` â†’ `Add New`.
3. Click on `Upload Plugin` and select the downloaded ZIP file.
4. Click on `Install Now` and then on `Activate`.
5. Done!
